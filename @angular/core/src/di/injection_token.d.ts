/**
 * Creates a token that can be used in a DI Provider.
 *
 * Use an `InjectionToken` whenever the type you are injecting is not reified (does not have a
 * runtime representation) such as when injecting an interface, callable type, array or
 * parametrized type.
 *
 * `InjectionToken` is parameterized on `T` which is the type of object which will be returned by
 * the `Injector`. This provides additional level of type safety.
 *
 * ```
 * interface MyInterface {...}
 * var myInterface = injector.get(new InjectionToken<MyInterface>('SomeToken'));
 * // myInterface is inferred to be MyInterface.
 * ```
 *
 * When creating an `InjectionToken`, you can optionally specify a factory function which returns
 * (possibly by creating) a default value of the parameterized type `T`. This sets up the
 * `InjectionToken` using this factory as a provider as if it was defined explicitly in the
 * application's root injector. If the factory function, which takes zero arguments, needs to inject
 * dependencies, it can do so using the `inject` function. See below for an example.
 *
 * Additionally, if a `factory` is specified you can also specify the `providedIn` option, which
 * overrides the above behavior and marks the token as belonging to a particular `@NgModule`. As
 * mentioned above, `'root'` is the default value for `providedIn`.
 *
 * ### Example
 *
 * #### Tree-shakeable InjectionToken
 *
 * {@example core/di/ts/injector_spec.ts region='ShakeableInjectionToken'}
 *
 * #### Plain InjectionToken
 *
 * {@example core/di/ts/injector_spec.ts region='InjectionToken'}
 *
